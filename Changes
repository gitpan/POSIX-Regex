0.90.1: Sun May 18 09:17:56 EDT 2008
   - Made the Makefile.PL require a modern ExtUtils::MakeMaker w/ ExtUtils::Constant

0.90: Sat May 17 06:54:46 EDT 2008
   - Fixed various error message typos
   - Fixed various BSD problems that hopefully also fix the same problems in solaris
     (installing a bsd virtual machine was enough trouble, ... where would I find solaris?)
     (bottom line: god bless the perl testers!)
