POSIX::Regex
============

This is a port of the glibc gnu regex engine into perl.  There are few reasons
you would need this.  The few I can think of include:

0) You wish to use untrusted user expressions in such a way as to be able to
catch errors.  Example:  eval { alarm 2;  m/((){1024}){1024}/ } is an instant
uncatchable segmentation fault.  GNU's regexps will still fail, but in a timeout
way rather than an instant segfault way.

1) You wish to have POSIX compliance on ... something ...  Perl's regexps are
slightly different -- arguably better, but different.


( ... if you think of anything else, let me know, since reason 0 evaporates under 5.9.3+ ... )
